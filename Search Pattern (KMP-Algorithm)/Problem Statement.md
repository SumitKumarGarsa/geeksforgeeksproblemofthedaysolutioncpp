Given two strings, one is a text string txt and the other is a pattern string pat. The task is to print the indexes of all the occurrences of the pattern string in the text string. Use 0-based indexing while returning the indices. 
Note: Return an empty list in case of no occurrences of pattern.

Examples : 
```
Input: txt = "abcab", pat = "ab"
Output: [0, 3]
Explanation: The string "ab" occurs twice in txt, one starts at index 0 and the other at index 3. 
```
```
Input: txt = "abesdu", pat = "edu"
Output: []
Explanation: There's no substring "edu" present in txt.
```
```
Input: txt = "aabaacaadaabaaba", pat = "aaba"
Output: [0, 9, 12]
```

Constraints:
1 ≤ txt.size() ≤ 106
1 ≤ pat.size() < txt.size()
Both the strings consist of lowercase English alphabets.
